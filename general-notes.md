# Notes

## Quality Attributes

- Systems are constructed to satisfy business goals ([^1], ch 21.1).
- Business goals are exemplified by quality attribute scenarios ([^1], chap. 21.1).
- Quality Attribute requirements (also "QA goals") are achieved through the application of tactics and patterns ([^1], chap. 21.1).
- Quality attribute utility tree connects ISO 25010 subcharacteristics (QAs), project-specific QAs, and Architecturally Significant Requirement Scenarios (project-specific QA scenarios) ([^1], chap. 19.4).
- Quality attribute requirements are satisfied by the structures and behaviors of the architecture ([^1], chap. 3.7).

## Functional requirements

- Functional requirements are satisfied by including an appropriate set of responsibilities within the design ([^1], chap. 3.7).
- Communication diagrams are useful when the task is to verify that an architecture can fulfill the functional requirements ([^1], chap. 22.5).
- Use cases describe how actors can use a system to accomplish their goals; they are frequently used to capture the functional requirements for a system ([^1], chap. 22.5).
- In contrast to trace notations, comprehensive notations show the complete behavior of structural elements ([^1], chap. 22.5).
