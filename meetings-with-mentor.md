    - [ ] "Extra work to spend less time in future"
  - [ ] Improve visibility
    - [ ] Move boxes manually
    - [ ] Explain

### Manager tasks

- Manager is responsible for budget cost scope quality and planning
- Identify blockers and help resolve them

### Meetings

- synchronization of views
- retro

### Our problems

- Unclear tasks
  - Anatoliy - in April
  - AbdelRahman - blocked on Yegor
- Some people say they have blockers to not work

### Not completed tasks

- List reasons for not completing tasks

### Retro

- Conduct at convenient time
- Still a process

### Hypothesis

- There will be less days when no one commits to the normalizer repo

### Action points

- [ ] Retrospective
  - [ ] Negotiate with Nickolay that we want to finish the project in July
  - [ ] Check with Nickolay whether he's satisfied with the goals for April (additional paper)
  - [ ] Discuss problems
  - [ ] Discuss bot
- [ ] Apply improvements to the presentation

## 19.04.2024

- Yegor sees problems, want to resolve them via sciences
- Yegor may want to see the full specification of the language
- Yegor needs us to develop his idea about a single optimization
- Nickolay doesn't want to give us management because he doesn't want to risk
- Anatoliy talks to Max about compiler

## 13.04.2024

### Requirements

- Consider traceability matrix
  - Non-functional requirements connected with functional requirements
  - Connect functional requirements with issues and tests

- Customer can ask for functionality
- Functionality can affect nonfunctional requirements
- Customer verifies requirements are correct and complete

### Tracking

- List of functional requirements

- parallelism
- if non confluent
- optimization of algorithms and ds

### Action points

- [ ] Create traceability matrix
- [ ] Link all requirements to issues
- [ ] Questionnaire - fill
  - [ ] Yegor - what are the expectations about speed?
- [x] Create architecture diagram
- [x] Diagram - publish here
- [x] Connect requirements to architecture
  - [x] Minimum
    - [x] QAS with details
  - [x] Max
    - [x] Check BCK
    - [x] Create issues

## 06.04.2024

- We have to manage risks till the end of the Industrial project.
- 27.04 - Nickolay passes management to Danila because Normalizer is implemented.
- Monitor implementation problems.
  - Example: Nickolay completed AbdelRahman’s task.
  - How to handle?
    - Retrospective?
- Completeness and correctness.
  - Explain requirements to each other.
  - Requirements can be incomplete.

### Action points

- [x] Set risk planning event in calendar till August
- [ ] Describe a process to monitor implementation problems
- [ ] Schedule a retrospective
- [ ] Describe a process to verify correctness and completeness of requirements

## 31.03.2024

### Risks

- Something that prevents from achieving a goal
  - If it doesn’t, it’s not a risk
- Risks motivate to plan
- Stakeholders may have different risks

### Planning

- Identify hard deadlines
- Adjust soft deadlines

### How to make X work?

- Discuss with X that something is important for a number of reasons
- Take a promise from X that something will be delivered by Y date
- X will feel guilty if X doesn’t accomplish a task

### Tracking

- Is it possible to split tasks?
- Can we split tasks to reduce uncertainty?
- How to represent tracking?
  - Timeline
  - Completed tasks

### Metrics

- What other metrics should we have?
  - Time behavior -> how fast should tests fail?

### Satisfaction

- Customer satisfaction survey
- Team satisfaction survey

### Blockers

- Yegor's team
  - Ask when the team will deliver

### Action points

- [ ] Define risks
  - [ ] For all stakeholders
- [x] Create an event in the calendar
  - [x] An hour to review risks
- [ ] Describe architecture
  - [ ] Read BCK
- [ ] Create a form to measure Yegor's satisfaction
- [ ] Create a team satisfaction survey
- [ ] Establish a process for asking
- [ ] Prepare timeline fo-  r tracking

## 09.03.2024

### Architecture

- Architecture
- Non-functional requirements
- Maintainability
- How to demonstrate compliance with architectural drivers?

### Action points

- [ ] Consider all sub-attributes of ISO and comment on each of them
- [ ] Choose and prioritize architectural drivers
- [ ] Prepare non-functional requirements described via Scenarios with metrics

## 02.03.2024

### Planning

- Original project duration - 12 months
- We want to complete the project in 7 months (by August).
- What data allows us to think we’ll be able to complete it in 7 months?
- How can other teams block us?
- How did we account for extra activities (exams, etc.)

### Sprints

- It’s enough to plan for two sprints in advance

### Tracking

- How do we know everything is OK?

### Processes

#### Scenario: new bug

- Set priority
- Assess complexity in story points
  - Create a matrix?
    - Rows - priority
    - Columns - complexity
    - Point in some quadrant -> action (fix, skip)

- How do we track requirements?
- How do we update requirements?

### Presentation

- Improve flow of slides
  - Logical transitions
- Rehearsal
- Time management
- Put everything on slides
  - More risks

### Meetings

- Agenda - we prepare
  - Includes action points from the previous meeting
  - Feedback
- Action points - derived from meeting notes
- Outlook - create event for meetings

### Proof

- Research can be planned - need experience
- Unnecessary depth
